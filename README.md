# Peripleo

*Peripleo* is a prototype application for the discovery and spatial visualisation of collection data, developed early in 2022 as part of the British Library's [**Locating a National Collection project**](https://britishlibrary.github.io/locating-a-national-collection/home.html) (LaNC).

LaNC has investigated how creating links between locations in different collections might open up new forms of research, engagement and interaction for different audiences. Project partners include: [The National Trust](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/), [Historic Royal Palaces](https://www.hrp.org.uk/), [Historic England](http://www.HistoricEngland.org.uk), [Historic Environment Scotland](https://www.historicenvironment.scot/), [Museum of London Archaeology](https://www.mola.org.uk/), [The Portable Antiquities Scheme](https://finds.org.uk/), and [English Heritage](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/).

LaNC was a Foundation project within the AHRC-funded [Towards a National Collection Programme](https://www.nationalcollection.org.uk/).

## Demonstration

Several examples of geospatial datasets rendered as maps using *Peripleo* can be seen on the project web site at https://britishlibrary.github.io/locating-a-national-collection/. 

## Installation

You can quickly deploy *Peripleo* for the visualisation of your own geospatial data, without any dedicated technical infrastructure. Follow the instructions given in:
1. the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/britishlibrary/peripleo/blob/main/README.md), and
2. the [Configuration Guide](https://github.com/britishlibrary/peripleo/blob/main/Configuration-Guide.md).
