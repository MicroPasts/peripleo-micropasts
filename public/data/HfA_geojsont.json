An important witness to the amateur interest in and practice of pharmaceutical medicine by King Henry VIII (b. 1491, d. 1547). Contains a collection of more than 100 medical recipes that have been organised into six sections: plasters; spasmadraps (dipped plasters); ointments; balms; waters, lotions, and decoctions; and cataplasms (poultices). As a number of the recipes indicate, the collection was designed for Henry VIII. This is also suggested by the fact that many recipes provide treatments for easing pain and swelling and cooling inflammation in the legs, and healing leg ulcers, conditions from which Henry VIII suffered following jousting accidents in 1527 and 1536. Over 30 recipes are attributed to the king himself, including one that he apparently devised for Anne of Cleves ('my ladye Anne of Cleve'), queen consort from 6 January to 9 July 1540. Many of the other recipes are attributed to his four royal physicians: William Butts (b. c. 1486, d. 1545) and John Chambre (b. 1470, d. 1549), who are famously depicted with the king on Hans Holbein the Younger's painting Henry VIII and the Barber Surgeons, and Walter Cromer (d. c. 1547), and Augustin de Angustinius (n. d.), a Venetian who was also physician to Cardinal Wolsey. They apparently devised their medical treatments both separately from and collaboratively with one another. The collection suggests that Henry VIII and his physicians predominantly relied on a medieval tradition of herbal, lapidary and chemical remedies. They evidently also subscribed to the medicinal properties of what they believed to be unicorn horn (alicorn). Various recipes, e.g. the Rochestre plastre, Emplastrum de cornubus, Swete Oyntement, Russett Oyntement, Gray plaster, and Unguentum de cornubus, require the use of powdered 'cornu unicornu' or 'unicornis horne'. William Butts also had access to learned medical works since the Italian surgeon Giovanni da Vigo (b. 1450, d. 1525), who published his Practica Copiosa in Arte Chirurgia in 1514, and the Greek physician Galen (129–199) are cited as his sources. The collection mentions the locations where a number of recipes were devised and put into practice. Henry VIII worked on treatments at Ampthill, Cawood, Fotheringhay, Greenwich, Hampton Court, St James, and Westminster; and the royal physicians worked on theirs at Farnham Castle, Greenwich, St James, the Manor of the More at Ricksmansworth, and Westminster. A number of anonymous recipes are located to still other places: Canterbury, Dover, Knolles, Petworth, and Rochester. These references suggest that Henry VIII and his physicians brought their apothecary equipment with them to the various royal palaces and other residencies they visited. The collection's medical treatments may have been designed over a long period of time: probably between 1536, when Henry VIII's leg condition is thought to have significantly worsened, and 1545, when William Butts died. The fact that the collection is neatly organised into sections with their own tables of contents suggests that it was copied in a single and preplanned undertaking. The reference to Anne of Cleves provides a terminus post quem. This indicates that the manuscript was written between c. 1540 and c. 1545, perhaps for Henry VIII or one of his physicians.

An important witness to the amateur interest in and practice of pharmaceutical medicine by King Henry VIII (b. 1491, d. 1547). Contains a collection of more than 100 medical recipes that have been organised into six sections: plasters; spasmadraps (dipped plasters); ointments; balms; waters, lotions, and decoctions; and cataplasms (poultices). As a number of the recipes indicate, the collection was designed for Henry VIII. This is also suggested by the fact that many recipes provide treatments for easing pain and swelling and cooling inflammation in the legs, and healing leg ulcers, conditions from which Henry VIII suffered following jousting accidents in 1527 and 1536. Over 30 recipes are attributed to the king himself, including one that he apparently devised for Anne of Cleves ('my ladye Anne of Cleve'), queen consort from 6 January to 9 July 1540. Many of the other recipes are attributed to his four royal physicians: William Butts (b. c. 1486, d. 1545) and John Chambre (b. 1470, d. 1549), who are famously depicted with the king on Hans Holbein the Younger's painting Henry VIII and the Barber Surgeons, and Walter Cromer (d. c. 1547), and Augustin de Angustinius (n. d.), a Venetian who was also physician to Cardinal Wolsey. They apparently devised their medical treatments both separately from and collaboratively with one another. The collection suggests that Henry VIII and his physicians predominantly relied on a medieval tradition of herbal, lapidary and chemical remedies. They evidently also subscribed to the medicinal properties of what they believed to be unicorn horn (alicorn). Various recipes, e.g. the Rochestre plastre, Emplastrum de cornubus, Swete Oyntement, Russett Oyntement, Gray plaster, and Unguentum de cornubus, require the use of powdered 'cornu unicornu' or 'unicornis horne'. William Butts also had access to learned medical works since the Italian surgeon Giovanni da Vigo (b. 1450, d. 1525), who published his Practica Copiosa in Arte Chirurgia in 1514, and the Greek physician Galen (129–199) are cited as his sources. The collection mentions the locations where a number of recipes were devised and put into practice. Henry VIII worked on treatments at Ampthill, Cawood, Fotheringhay, Greenwich, Hampton Court, St James, and Westminster; and the royal physicians worked on theirs at Farnham Castle, Greenwich, St James, the Manor of the More at Ricksmansworth, and Westminster. A number of anonymous recipes are located to still other places: Canterbury, Dover, Knolles, Petworth, and Rochester. These references suggest that Henry VIII and his physicians brought their apothecary equipment with them to the various royal palaces and other residencies they visited. The collection's medical treatments may have been designed over a long period of time: probably between 1536, when Henry VIII's leg condition is thought to have significantly worsened, and 1545, when William Butts died. The fact that the collection is neatly organised into sections with their own tables of contents suggests that it was copied in a single and preplanned undertaking. The reference to Anne of Cleves provides a terminus post quem. This indicates that the manuscript was written between c. 1540 and c. 1545, perhaps for Henry VIII or one of his physicians.

Whereas the British Museum's catalogue describes this manuscript as a 'collection of 328 original Letters to Sir Robert Cotton' [see Planta, Catalogue (1802), p. 9], it actually contains 364 items of which more than 360 are original letters addressed to Robert Cotton. Many of the letters concern loans from and acquisitions of manuscripts for the Cottonian Library. Among the authors are famous poets and playwrights, such as John Donne (b. 1572, d. 1631) – who thanks Cotton for lending him books during his imprisonment for his secret marriage – John Florio (b. 1553, d. 1625), Ben Jonson (b. 1572, d. 1637), and John Lyly (b. 1554, d. 1606). Other letters are written by historians such as William Camden (b. 1551, d. 1623), John Selden (b. 1584, d. 1654), and John Speed (b. 1551/1552, d. 1629); and manuscript collectors such as the astrologer and mathematician John Dee (b. 1527, d. 1609), Thomas Howard (b. 1585, d. 1646), 2nd Earl of Arundel, founder of the Arundel collection, Henry Savile of Banke (b. 1568, d. 1617), and James Ussher (b. 1581, d. 1656), Archbishop of Armagh. Among the few items not addressed to Robert Cotton are a letter by the playwright and poet Thomas Nashe (bap. 1567, d. c. 1601) to William Cotton (d. 1621), Bishop of Exeter, and a contract between the antiquarian Simonds D'Ewes (b. 1602, d. 1650) and Sir Thomas Cotton (b. 1594, d. 1662), second Baronet, the only surviving child of Sir Robert Cotton, who maintained the Cottonian Library after his father's death.

In the manuscript Henry VIII is depicted as king David and Jean Mallard compares him to David in the dedicatory letter preceding the Psalter. As indicated by the many marginal notes added in the King's own hand, the volume became Henry VIII's personal copy of the Psalms. Decoration:. 8 miniatures in colours and gold: the royal coat of arms, at the beginning of Mallard's dedicatory letter (f. 1v), and at the beginning of Psalms: f. 3, Henry VIII as David reading in his bedchamber (Psalm 1); f. 30r, David and Goliath (Psalm 26); f. 48r, battle scene (Psalm 38); f. 63v, Henry VIII and his court jester William Sommers (Psalm 52); f. 79r, Henry as David kneeling in prayer among ruins (Psalm 68); f. 98v, Musicians (Psalm 80); f. 118r, Angels singing (Psalm 97) (Psalm 109 does not have a miniature). Large initials in colours and gold containing flowers, birds, fruits, and insects, at the beginning of other Psalms. Smaller initials in gold on red, blue, brown, or black grounds, or in black on gold grounds, at the beginning of verses.

The work was very popular, as attested by the number of translations and including this anonymous French translation, Des cleres et nobles femmes, completed in the early 15th century. The French translation of the De mulieribus claris typically includes a cycle of miniatures. This manuscript contains the oldest redaction of this translation (see: McKendrick, Lowden and Doyle, Royal Manuscripts (2011), no.70). Contents:. ff. 1r-168r: Des cleres et nobles femmes, an anonymous French translation of Boccacio's De mulieribus claris.. Decoration:. 106 miniatures in colours and gold with partial bar borders and large foliate initials in colours and gold (ff. 2v, 5r (in four panels with a full border), 7r, 8v, 11r, 12r, 13r, 15r, 16v, 17v, 19r, 20r, 20v, 22r, 24r, 26r, 27v, 29r, passim). Partial bar border in colours and gold with foliate motifs, and a large initial in colours and gold with the Beaufort badge of a portcullis and chains surmounted by a coronet (f. 1r). Partial bar border in colours and gold with foliate motifs and a large initial in colours and gold (f. 167v). 'Champ' initials in colours and gold. Line fillers in blue, red, and gold. Capitals marked in yellow. The decoration is attributed to the Master of Boethius, who illuminated the French translation of Boethius's De consolatione philosophie in a manuscript now Paris, BnF, MS fr. 12459 and who was active in Paris c. 1410. The miniatures are not based directly on the earlier Parisian manuscript of Des cleres et nobles femmes made for the dukes of Burgundy and Berry (see: McKendrick, Lowden and Doyle, Royal Manuscripts (2011), no.70). . The subjects of the illustrations are as follow:. f. 2v: Boccaccio presenting the work to Andrea Acciaioli, Countess of Altavilla. f. 5r: A frontispiece in four panels of Boccaccio reading a book,

In addition to the Decretum, the volume also includes the Glossa ordinaria, a systematic textual commentary in the form of marginal glosses that was composed by the Italian canonist Bartholomew of Brescia (d. 1258), and the Historiae super libro Decretorum (Stories concerning the book of decrees), written by the same author. The latter work is a compilation of biblical stories collected by Bartholomew, which illustrate points of canon law, arranged under the appropriate distinctiones or causae. The manuscript was not originally made for an English patron, but a number of added glosses throughout the volume suggest that it had arrived in England by the fourteenth century. It later came into the posssession of Howel Kyffin, Dean of St Asaph in northern Wales (between 1381 and 1384). A letter from the Prior of Belvoir to the Prior of St. Albans, concerning a quittance for a parson of Great Rissington, which dates to the late 15th century, was once inserted into the manuscript as a detached leaf (now Royal MS 14 B LI). Contents:. ff. 1r-343v: Gratian's Decretum, with the Glossa ordinaria of Bartholomew of Brescia. ff. 345r-348v: Bartholomew of Brescia, Historiae super libro Decretorum..
