His achievements included discovery of open sea from Atlantic to Pacific below South America: opening of English trade in the Far East: and claim to the Western region of North America for England. Naming it Nova Albion (New England) and thereby linking it with claims to the east coast and encouraging subsequent colonization of the Eastern seaboard.
