The bezel is bi-faceted, divided by a central ridge to each side of which it is concave with smaller ridges at each edge. The shoulders revert to a flattened form, narrowing to the hoop which gives them a trapezoidal appearance. The hoop itself is D-shaped, but a very flattened D which is shallow. It is decorated on both the bezel and shoulders with carefully arranged geometrical designs. On the bezel these are composed of transverse lines, arranged to form two bands, with four individual lines in total. Between these bands, which are akin to heraldic designs, are smaller cross hatchings which make the bands themselves appear striped. The transverse bands do not align with one another. The design continues on the shoulders, but the engraving is shallower and more worn and is unclear. There is a suggestion that rather than individual bands, the design switches to saltires at this point. There is further decoration on the interior of the ring, arranged as a chequered band which shadows the interior. This fades out before recommencing, and is extremely worn. There is a possible star, part of an extremely worn inscription, but this is very speculative and could be simple scratching or damage. Dimensions: The hoop is 22.9mm in diameter. It is 7.2mm wide and 3.2mm thick at the bevel, 0.9mm thick at the hoop. It weighs 4.95g.Discussion: This type of ring is related to contemporary iconographic rings (such as Oman, 1974, plate 68f dated to the late 15th century) but lack the religious imagery, instead having simple geometric or floral decoration. A very similar example was recorded in Devon in 2019 (Shipley 2019). Other very similar examples reported through the Treasure act include WILT-709CC7 (Tanner 2013), WAW-843792 (2017 T119, Bolton 2017) and SUSS-73C8C4 (2013 T910, Smith 2013). All these examples are dated to the late 15th and early 16th centuries.Conclusion: On the balance of probabilities this object is likely to be over 300 years old. As it is also made from precious metal, it constitutes potential Treasure under the Treasure Act 1996.","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.504212,50.662315]}},{"@id":"https://w3id.org/hfa_pas_exeter/ff99d214-4ca0-48cc-80bf-665133c14185","type":"Feature","properties":{"title":"DAGGER","id":1022539,"url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/1022539","description":"A copper alloy dagger pommel dating to the post medieval period, c.

The stamp appears to have irregular edges, with a channel at the six o'clock position that cuts through the rim created by the stamp's application. The stamp has resulted in a raised inscription which reads:\"E.XO/NL\"In the centre of the inscription, between the O and N, lies a raised design of three towers, the arms of the city of Exeter. The arms of Exeter, with their distinctively formed representation of Rougemont Castle (described as being triangular and triple towered in the blazon) were awarded in 1564. They are seen on a variety of objects, ranging from trade tokens to finger rings, where they were used as the mark of the city's assay office, as on DEV-E119FD. They feature on other weights, notably a copper alloy weight dating to the 16th century, recorded as SOM-F89D00. Ricketts (1996: 237) depicts a number of stamps and marks used to confirm weights and measures in the city of Exeter in the 19th century, almost all of which feature the three tower design. The city was apparently so attached to this design that it continued to use its own stamps for thirty years after national designs were imposed in the mid 1850s. This example in lead appears to act as evidence for continuity between the 16th and 19th century stamped weights of the city, as the style of the lettering appears 18th century in date. During this period, Exeter flourished as a trading and developing industrial centre, with foundries and workshops producing high quality objects such as Brufords silversmiths, and the large Willey's and Garton and King iron workshops. The initial L is possibly the mark of the workshop or tradesperson using the weight, which weighs close to 4oz.

The object is lozenge shaped, it appears square at first glimpse but the position of its heraldic design implies that it would have been positioned to appear lozengiform. There is a short cylindrical attachment stud on the reverse, which is integrally cast, although the tip of the stud is now broken off. The upper surface is dominated by a heraldic design in red enamel, depicting a porcupine passant left. The porcupine looks to have once been infilled with silver or gilding, giving the arms the heraldic description: gules, porcupine passant left argent/or. There is a question and debate over the difference between a heraldic porcupine and the similarly prickly hedgehog, sometimes called an urchin. However, the length of the spines, the shape of the head and the snout appear to confirm that this is a porcupine and not a hedgehog. In terms of possible heraldic connections, the prominent Grylls family of Cornwall use a porcupine passant left as a device, as demonstrated on the post medieval CORN-AD6552. They are described in Cadell and Davies (1814) as being a Devon family who moved to Cornwall in the later 16th century and then became more prosperous through advantageous marriages. Whether the device was used in the medieval period by the same family is unclear.Putting the porcupine like features aside, the hedgehog device is also often associated with families with the name Harris.

The wings are cylindrical, and appear to have been potentially hollow although the apertures at the terminals are partly filled with debris- the opening is visible in the central rectangular notch which would have once housed the hinge, attached to a pin which presumably filled the hollow wings. Above the wings rears the head plate, which is comprised of a rectangular plate and the stub of the once circular head loop. Only a small part of the left hand side of this circle survives. The rectangular plate is decorated with four transverse grooves, which give a slatted effect. The second space between these grooves is further elaborated by incised cross hatching. The bow rises gently from below the wings, and is much plainer in decoration, having only two deeply incised grooves extending vertically downwards, tracking its outer perimeter. This brooch forms part of a group of south western variants on T-shaped brooches discussed by Bayley and Butcher (2004: 167-8, fig. 140) which they define as characteristic of the second century.

AD 50-150.The brooch comprises the wings and part of the bow, the lower part of the bow, footplate and pin are all now missing. The wings are cylindrical in shape with a broad rectangular notch at the centre where a significant amount of iron decay suggests that the iron hinge would have been located. The bow rises gently from the centre of the wings, and is flattened in cross section. It curves very steadily downwards to the break. The wings are decorated with a number of incised vertical lines, and the notch for the hinge is highlighted with an incised saltire enclosed within an outer square. Beneath this is a band of diagonal incised decorative lines, the ends of which sweep downwards to form an incised triangle. This leads into the decorative scheme on the bow, which is composed of a series of two surviving lozenges, each of which has a red enamelled smaller lozenge at its centre, although the enamel in the lower lozenge is less well preserved. The incised outer lines of the lozenges give the appearance of crossing over one another. The reverse is plain and undecorated. The lozenge style decoration is known from other south western variants of developed T-shaped brooches, including DEV-8F48F4, DEV-476924, and SOM-5E626E. Like the latter object, this example is similar to Mackreth's (2011: plate 63) no. 2759, identified as a type 12a. Another example of a developed T-shaped brooch can be seen illustrated by Bayley and Butcher (2004: 166, Hull's type 105/6), a development of the Flavian \"initial\" T-shaped brooch, they are dated to the late first and second centuries (ibid: 167). Bayley and Butcher (2004, 167-168) suggest that such brooches form a group with a distinctly South-Western distribution (see also finds list in Wedlake 1982, 127), and can be dated to AD 50 to 160.Measurements: 25.1mm length, 35.4mm width, 4.8mm thickness (wings), 8.2mm width 3.1mm thickness (bow), weight 8.11g.","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.447313,50.743331]}},{"@id":"https://w3id.org/hfa_pas_exeter/d2c90893-a8ff-4f46-b2ab-1afe40d391d0","type":"Feature","properties":{"title":"COIN","id":1015989,"url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/1015989","description":"A silver Roman denarius of Septimius Severus (AD 193-211) dating to AD 194.FELICITAS TEMPOR reverse type depicting ears of corn between two cornucopiae.

The remaining stem is c20mm in length and hexagonal in cross-section, the sides of the hexagon at the front and rear being longer to create an approximate oval.The knop is c14mm in length and consists of a section representing the elongated top of the acorn (which appears to be a continuation of the stem with a rounded end) together with a wider section representing the acorn cup, which appears to have been welded on as a separate piece.

The wings are cylindrical, c.5.1mm in diameter, and hold the partial remains of a copper alloy axis bar in situ. Into the reverse of the head a rectangualr slot has been cut centrally to accomodate a pin, now lost.The bow expands out from the head with a width of 9.1mm, sub-rectangular in cross section and with a very slightly convex outer face, 3.8mm thick. Initially expanding out relatively level, there is subsequently a break in angle of around 90 degrees, from which point the brooch continues largely straight before terminating in a wron break. The bow does not survive to its original width at the break, however the width appears to remain largely consistant.The bow is decorated with a border of punched pellets, running along both edges and along the head, parallel with the wings. At the top of the bow, as it expands from the head, their is the suggestion of a downwards pointing triangle within this border, again of punched pellets, although this is obscured by abrasion. Lower down the bow, prior to the break, is a circular depression, most likely a cell for inlaid enamel decoration, with this followed by a second sub-rectangular or triangular cell, truncated by the break.

The axe head is 58.7mm long with a sub-rectangular mouth and with a small triangular protrusion at the centre of each lateral edge, in line with well-defined casting seams running the length of the axe head. The external edge of the mouth is 41.8mm wide and 29.5mm thick, the internal edge of the mouth is 27.0mm wide and 18.9mm thick, the socket is 46.3mm deep.Below the mouth the axe narrows to 38.6mm wide and 23.6mm thick. The blade has a sub-rectangular to hexagonal cross section, with both lateral faces expanding into a pronounced longitudinal, central ridge with the casting seam at the centre. The blade is sub-rectangular when viewed in plan, flaring into a slightly convex cutting edge which is 39.2mm wide, when viewed in profile the blade is triangular, tapering from the mouth to the cutting edge, 3.9mm thick.From one lateral face expands a sub-rectangular attachment loop, 23.4mm long, connecting to the axe head at the juncture between the mouth and blade and just prior to the mid-point of the blade. This loop has a sub-oval cross section, c. 3.7mm thick and with the width of the axe including the loop being 38.6mm. On each broad face of the axe are a set of three slightly converging longitudinal ribs, cast in low relief.The axe head weighs 110.35g.Discussion:  Although unusually squat, the axe head otherwise fits in well with the Ewart Park phase of Late Bronze Age metal working, giving it a likely date of c. 1000-800 BC. Very similar socketed axe heads of comparable sizes (c. 60mm in length) from late Bronze Age hoards can be seen illustrated both by Savory (1980: 190, no. 281:7), found as part of a hoard recovered in Llantwit Major, Glam, and recorded onto the Portable Antiquities Scheme database, from a founder's hoard in Herefordshire (2015 T663; Adams 2015).A Bronze Age fragment of a probable chisel or awl, not under consideration as Treasure, had been found previously on the site by a separate finder, probably in the first half of 2016. This was handed into the Royal Albert Memorial Museum for identification on the 8th of July, 2016 and has now been recorded onto the Portable Antiquities Scheme database as DEV-BA9812. This is highly fragmentary and largely undiagnostic, but is probably a fragment of a middle or late Bronze Age chisel.Given their greatly varying states of preservation, and considering a reported wet area in the centre of the field, multiple depositions cannot be ruled out with certainty. However, with incomplete tools and other \"scrap\" being a noted feature of hoards of the Ewart Park phase of metal working (Needham 1996), on the balance of probability these objects seem likely to represent two components of a Late Bronze Age hoard probably disturbed by cultivation.Conclusion: Given the condition of the axe head the previous find of Bronze Age chisel in the vicinity, it is reasonable to suggest that both finds were deposited as part of a hoard. Given their prehistoric date the axe head therefore qualifies as potential Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.Wil PartridgeFinds Liaison Officer for Devon & SomersetJuly 2017Seen by Neil Wilkin, Curator, The British Museum,January 2018","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.443909,50.691747]}},{"@id":"https://w3id.org/hfa_pas_exeter/89dd7c20-5967-4d20-b58b-50d291d89c9b","type":"Feature","properties":{"title":"HARNESS PENDANT","id":843760,"url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/843760","description":"Medieval cast copper alloy heraldic harness pendant. The pendant is lozenge shaped. From the top point of the lozenge projects a transverse suspension loop. The loop has a rectangular sectioned shank widening to a ring shaped terminal which projects slightly forward of the main pendant.The front of the pendant appears to be decorated with the arms: Or, three torteaux a label azure; ie gold with three red circles and a blue line across the top which has three short lines descending from it. However two regular areas on each point of the label lack enamel and it is possible the arms were further differenced by designs on the points. The enamel mostly survives well but the gilded background is very worn. The back and loop are plain. It is 38.7mm long including the loop, 24.1mm wide and 6.3mm thick including the loop, 2.3mm excluding it.Harness pendants are generally dated from the twelfth to the fourteenth century, with enamelled and heraldic types predominating in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries (Griffiths, 1995:62). 'Or, three torteaux a label azure' were the arms of the Courtneys from about 1200, including those who were Earls of Devon, between AD 1276 and 1458. Junior branches of the family differenced these arms by adding designs to the points, for example three bezants in the case of the Courtneys of Powderham and three mitres for Archbishop William Courtney. A member differencing the arms with two designs has not yet been identified in preliminary researches. The pendant may have been used by a supporter of the Courtneys or a retainer or by a family member. See PUBLIC-E82839 and IOW-DB7A13 on this database for similar examples with the same arms.","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.566961,50.708621]}},{"@id":"https://w3id.org/hfa_pas_exeter/dc231d7a-f683-4688-b2e9-9cde19594ccb","type":"Feature","properties":{"title":"CROTAL","id":842961,"url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/842961","description":"Cast copper alloy Post Medieval spherical crotal bell dating from the 18th century.

Either side of the sound slit, and at the centre of the 'sunburst' pattern, are two semi circles with ethe initials R and W, both flanked by two pellets. This suggests that the bell was manufactured by the founder Robert Wells or his son, Robert Wells Junior, of Aldbourne, Wiltshire, who were producing them from 1760-1799.

The base of the handle is octagonal in section; the rest of the handle is broken away and is missing. The face of the oval die is somewhat worn and the engraving is not clear in some places. At the bottom is a square topped shield; within the shield is an engraving of a double-headed eagle with open wings.

Publ., XLIII (1902), 93Other brief references to the hoard by Hearne suggest that it was found in 1716.W. Stukeley, Itin, Cur. (1724), 151, described the find thus:\"A pot of Roman coyn of two pecks was dug up two years agoe [sic], near St. Martin's Church. I saw some of them in Dr. Musgrave's possession, of Gordian, Balbinus, Philippus, Julia Maesa, Geta, Gallienus, and the like. Mr. Loudham, surgeon in this city, has many of them amongst his curious collection of antiquitys, MSS. etc. Mr. Reynolds the schoolmaster is a great collector and preserver of such learned remains.\"Dr. J.G. Milne, in NC, 1948, 219-23, discussed the above references, and also the entries of gifts of coins from the hoard in the Benefactors' Book of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. These coins, 17 in number, are in Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.Dr. Milne pointed out that W.T.P. Shortt, Sylva Antiqua Iscana (1840), vi, \"stated that Reynolds' coins were in the possession of the Dean and Chapter of Exeter. They are still in the Cathedral Library, and with them there is an account of the find and a list of the coins by Mr. Reynolds which accompanied his gift..The character of the find can be determined with much probability from this detailed story. The flooring of chalk and sand, apparently some three feet below the modern surface, and with two later floors over it, can be taken as certainly Roman; and as the coins were buried two feet below this in a leaden urn, they appear to have formed a concealment hoard.If the Corpus coins and the single pieces shown to Hearne are added to the list given by Reynolds, the total of identified specimens is as follows:\"Claudius I 1 (b.)Trajan 1Severus 5Julia Domna 2Caracalla 2Geta 2Elagabalus 7Julia Paula 1Julia Soaemias 1Julia Maesa 2Severus Alexander 7Julia Mamaea 2Maximinus 2Gordian I 1Gordian III 20Philip I 13Otacilia 2Philip II 2Trajan Decius 7Etruscilla 1Herennius 4Hostilian 1Treb.

So the preponderance of coins of Gallienus and Postumus would probably be even more marked than appears in the figures above, which, if the statement that the urn contained about half a bushel is correct, would not cover a tenth of the whole.\"N. Shiel, in P.T. Bidwell, The Legionary Bath-house and Basilica and Forum at Exeter, (1979), 167-79, reviewed the earlier accounts, which led him to date the discovery to 1715. He also listed 87 ant. in Rougemont House Museum (now Royal Albert Memorial Museum), Exeter, 207 den. and ant. in Exeter Cathedral Library, and 16 ant. in Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, with types, sizes, and die axes, and gave reasons for the belief that these came from the Exeter, 1715/6 hoard:Den.

The fastener was part of a sword belt, and was used in place of the normal buckle. It is likely that these strap fittings would have been tinned or gilded.

Worrell suggests (pers comm, March 2013) that the item is not a Roman stylus or a stamp, but that the item 'looks like a very exuberantly decorated Roman object', and points out that saltires are known as a decorative method on Roman objects. Leahy also belives the item is not a stylus, nor a pot stamp, reporting that 'the only surviving pot stamps are made from bone and the evidence at Cleatham suggested that each was only used on one pot making the use of wood likely.' Leahy goes on to suggest that another possibility could be 'a leather worker's stamp but decoration looks too crude from this function, leather stamps seem to have been neatly cut'. Leahy postulates that it could be a similar object to those that Anglo-Saxon ladies suspended from their belts, particularly the 'Hercules club' pendants..However, on checking Meaney's book [could not find a parallel]'.

The coins All of the coins were heavily mineralised and in extremely fragile condition. However, ten of the 22 could be at least partially identified. The earliest appears to be a copper as of Augustus (c. 23 BC-AD 14), while the latest identifiable issues are of the reign of Claudius (AD 41-54). Although the remaining 12 coins were far too corroded to allow any identification, there was nothing to suggest that the hoard post-dated the Julio-Claudian period. That said a later first century (or even second century) deposition date cannot be ruled out. This group is extremely unusual for a hoard of Roman copper alloy coins due to the inclusion of such early types.The coins can be summarised as follows: Augustus (probable) 1 Claudius 6 Antonia 2 Claudius (possible) 1 Uncertain 12 Total 22 Age, number and metal The coins easily satisfy the criteria of the Treasure Act with regard to their age, metal and quantity; being more than 300 years old, struck in copper alloy and being more than ten in number. Of the same find? The circumstances of discovery make it clear that the coins were all deposited together in antiquity. Furthermore, the archaeological context suggests that the coins were deposited as part of a cremation burial. A number of other Roman artefacts, including glass, pottery, metalwork and organics were discovered from the same archaeological context (comprising archaeological context nos. 3053-56). The material listed on the attached document should all be considered Treasure by association with the coins.

The quay house was rebuilt in 1680 - 1681 so that cloth and other goods could be stored before they were loaded onto boats and shipped down Exeter canal. the seal shows evidence of trade between the city of Exeter and the city of London during the 1600's.

This makes the coin nearly one thousand and seven hundred years old.The obverse (or the 'heads') of the coin show Constantine 'the second' wearing armour on his shoulders. The emperor is wearing a laurel wreath on his head. The words on the coin are in Latin, which was the language spoken by the Romans. The words translate into English as  'Constantine Junior, most noble Caesar'. The reverse (or the 'tails') of the coin shows two Roman soldiers with two military standards. Military standards were tall poles with different symbols on. Different units of the Roman army had their own standard. In battle, one of the soldiers would carry the standard in front so that the other soldiers could follow him.The Latin words on the reverse of the coin translate into English as 'The Glorious Army'.At the bottom of the coin are some letters. These letters are important because they show where the coin was made. The letters or 'mintmark' show us that this coin was made in a place called Nicomedia.

The tile was originally square in shape with two flat faces and four sides. The tile is now broken into a broadly right-angled triangular shape with approximnately 50 percent of the tile now missing. The front face depicts a fish motif within a steeply arched border in cream slip; a round eye, slightly down-turned mouth and curved gill are depicted 'negatively' in brown. There are traces of lead glaze remaining on the front surface. The back face and sides are plain. This tile is highly likely to be from the nearby Medieval Priory of St Katherine at Polsloe, Exeter. John Allan identifies the tile as 'Allan and Keen design 25; the commonest form discovered at Polsloe Priory during excavations in 1976 - 1978. Monastery floors were sold locally as building materials, and often moved after the Reformation, which may reflect why the tile was discovered some distance from, yet still within the vicinity of the priory. Similar tiles can be seen in St Andrew's chapel in Exeter Cathedral. These tiles were certainly made close to Exeter, but the kiln site has not been found'. (John Allan, pers comm 22/4/14).In 2009 an archaeological evaluation revealed 9 Medieval tile fragments, dating from the 13th to early 14th centuries AD, which were discovered within the curtilage of the Priory (Parnell 2009: Exeter Archaeology Report Number 09.92). Medieval tiles such as this were produced by setting clay into a square frame, to form the square shape of the tile. Then the design or motif was stamped into the soft clay, forming an impression. The stamped impression was infilled with a white slip, and the whole surface was levelled off with a wire in order to reveal and define the motif, which would contrast in white against the brown clay background. The tile was then coated in lead glaze and fired in a kiln.","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.50099,50.724502]}},{"@id":"https://w3id.org/hfa_pas_exeter/c1d516f0-e6f7-4838-9a60-374ba4e0d345","type":"Feature","properties":{"title":"COIN","id":144598,"url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/144598","description":"Copper alloy rose farthing of Charles I (1625-1649).
